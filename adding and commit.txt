The purpose of the git add command is that I'm essentially prompting git and
letting it know that I want to track this file, and
that it will be included as part of my commit. 
#git add test.txt
#git status
.
.
.
#git restore  stage test.txt
..
For this, I can use the git restore command with the flag-- stage and
the file name test.txt.
Running the command will unstage the file from the commit.
I then run git status one more time to see the file is back to an untracked status.
So once again I'll add the file using git add test.txt.
Run git status, and now notice that the file is back in a tracked state.
