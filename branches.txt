it's good practice to specify dash U.
This means that I'm only going to
get updates from the upstream,
which in this case will be the main branch.
The result of this is that
the origin won't be my main branch anymore. 
...the feature/lesson will be the main branch...

it will ask your username
username : abdulkhader07
password : enter your pass
 boom!
git hub will recognise new branch 
.
.
.
go to github then it will display : compare and pull request in green 
click on it.....>
go down commit

.
.
.
you can 
#git status
#git checkout main
comming out of featuure/lesson branch
#git pull

....Notice that the test2.txt file is now available.
I can also verify that by doing
a simple check within
the directory by using the ls command....
#ls
